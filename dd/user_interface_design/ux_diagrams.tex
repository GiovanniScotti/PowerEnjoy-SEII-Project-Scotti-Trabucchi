The purpose of the UX diagram is to show the different screens provided by the user interface of a particular application and their dynamic contents. Moreover it points out the interactions among the screens themselves and the presence of input forms and required data in a specific screen.

The diagrams provided below follow the User Interface requirements stated in the RASD document~\cite{rasd}.

The Web and the Mobile applications implement the same functionalities. This is why just a single UX diagram for both the applications has been attached to this document. Please notice that:
\begin{itemize}
\item \emph{\color{red} red} words describe functionalities accessible from the mobile application only (for example the provision of GPS data to the system);
\item \emph{\color{blue} blue} words describe functionalities offered by the web application only;
\item The possible choices of the user (e.g.: the car to be rented, the GPS coordinates...) have been depicted as \emph{Input Forms} since they are data to be sent to the system and imply a screen update.
\end{itemize}
The UX diagram of both the Web and the Mobile applications is shown in Figure \ref{web_mobile_ux}. \\
The UX diagram of the on-board application is shown in Figure \ref{on_board_ux}.

Also note that there is no screen marked with the "\$" symbol: this is because no page acts as a home page reachable from anywhere in the application; the first screen to be shown is of course the "Authentication" one.}
