This sections includes further details on the interfaces between different components of the system. Also, Subsection \ref{int_comps_if} is devoted to illustrate some relevant details about the interface among internal elements of the Application Server and interfaces between said elements and other layers of the system.

\subsection{Database - Application Server}
The Application Server is the only one that can access the Database directly; this is done through the Java Persistence API mapping between objects and actual relations.

\subsection{Web Server - Web Browsers}
The interactions between the client's browsers and the Web Servers are based on the HTTPS protocol, as previously specified in the RASD~\cite{rasd}.

\subsection{Application Server - Web Server and Clients}
The communication between Application Server and clients, both direct and via the Web Server, must happen via RESTful APIs provided by the Application Server itself and implemented using JAX-RS.

\subsection{Application Server - External Systems}
The Application Server must connect with two types of external systems:
\begin{itemize}
\item A Maintenance System, to which the Application Server must offer an interface API in order to provide access to data needed for maintenance interventions;
\item One or more Payment Handlers, that provide the interface APIs to which the Application server itself must adapt in order to perform payments of any kind.
\end{itemize}
