This section describes the dynamic behaviour of the system in the most relevant cases.

The following sequence diagrams highlight the runtime interactions between clients, servers and the database; in the case of internal interaction between sub-components of the Application Server, these interactions are expanded and detailed. This is not the case with the client applications, since the internal structure is simpler and there is no need to further detail said relations.

Direct interactions between the Application Server and the Database are not explicitly represented, since such interactions are abstracted by the persistence unit of the Application Server.
