This section gives a detailed view of the physical and logical infrastructure of the system-to-be, as well as the description of the main components and their interactions.

A top down approach will be adopted for the description of the architectural design of the system:
\begin{description}
\item[Section \ref{high_level_comps}] A description of high-level components and their interactions.
\item[Section \ref{component_view}] A detailed insight of the components described in the previous section.
\item[Section \ref{deployment_view}] A set of indications on how to deploy the illustrated components on physical tiers.
\item[Section \ref{runtime_view}] A thorough description of the dynamic behaviour of the software, complete with diagrams for the key functionalities.
\item[Section \ref{component_if}] A description of the different type of interfaces among the various described components.
\item[Section \ref{sel_arch_styles_patterns}] A list of the architectural styles, design patterns and paradigms adopted in the design phase.
\item[Section \ref{other_decisions}] A list of all other relevant design decisions that were not mentioned before.
