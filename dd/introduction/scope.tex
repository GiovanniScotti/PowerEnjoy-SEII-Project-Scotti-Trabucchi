The system aims to support a car-sharing service that exclusively employs electric cars.

The system is structured in a four-layered fashion, which will be thoroughly described in this document, that adapts to several forms of clients: various types of actors that interact with the system-to-be by generating a client-server dualism, hence a flow of requests-responses.

The architecture must be designed with the intent of being maintainable and extensible, also forseeing future changes.

This document aims to drive the implementation phase so that cohesion and decoupling are increased as much as possible. In order to do so, individual components must not include too many unrelated functionalities and reduce interdependency between one another.

Specific architectural styles and design patterns will be followed in this document and used for future implementation, as well as common design paradigms that combine useful features of said concepts.
