The Design Document is intended to provide a deeper functional description of the \emph{PowerEnJoy} system-to-be by giving technical details and describing the main architectural components as well as their interfaces and their interactions. The relations among the different modules are pointed out using UML standards and other useful diagrams showing the structure of the system.

The document aims to guide the software development team to implement the architecture of the project, by providing a stable reference and a single vision of all parts of the software itself and clearly defining how they work.
