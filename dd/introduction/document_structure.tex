This document consists of five sections:

\begin{description}
\item[Section 1: Introduction.] This section provides a general introduction and overview of the Design Document and the covered topics not previously taken into account by the RASD~\cite{rasd}.
\item[Section 2: Architectural Design.] It shows the main system components together with sub-components and their relationship. This section is divided into different parts whose focus is mainly on design choices, interactions, architectural styles and patterns.
\item[Section 3: Algorithm Design.] This section provides a high-level description and details about some of the most crucial and critical algorithms to be implemented by the system-to-be.
\item[Section 4: User Interface Design.] It provides an overview on how the user interface will look like and behave giving further information with respect to those contained in the RASD~\cite{rasd}.
\item[Section 5: Requirements Traceability.] This section describes how the requirements defined in the RASD~\cite{rasd} are mapped to the design elements defined in this document.
\end{description}
At the end of the document are an \textbf{Appendix} and a \textbf{Bibliography}, providing additional information about the sections listed above.
