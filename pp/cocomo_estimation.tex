\section{Scale Drivers}
Some of the most important factors contributing to a project's duration and cost are the Scale Drivers. Each of the said drivers describes the project itself and determines the exponent used in the Effort Equation. More precisely, the Scale Drivers reflect the non-linearity of the effort with relation to the number of SLOC. Each scale driver has a range of rating levels from \textit{Very Low} to \textit{Extra High}.
