The goals of \hbox{\emph{PowerEnJoy}} are the following:

\begin{enumerate}
\item Let the user register to the service and login via the provided credentials;
\item Let the user manage his/her own profile;
\item Let the driver find the location of nearby available cars and reserve a chosen car up to an hour before picking it up;
\item Improve the efficiency of the service by assuring that no car stays reserved for more than an hour if not actually in use;
\item Allow the user to easily access the cars by unlocking them once the driver is in proximity;
\item Automatically manage payments in order to make the service quicker and more dynamic to use; 
\item Allow every registered user who reserved a car to drive it for a ride;
\item Manage the security of the cars by locking them properly after every ride;
\item Incentivize responsible behaviors, providing discounts for the worthiest users and additional charges for bad users.
\end{enumerate}
