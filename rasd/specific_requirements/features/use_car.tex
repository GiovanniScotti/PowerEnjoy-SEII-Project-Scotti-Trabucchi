\subsubsection{Purpose}
The use car feature is the key feature of the whole system. For the sake of completeness, this requirement is described by detailing each of its sub-parts, as seen in Figure \ref{global_uc}.
The detailed sub-parts are described in the subsections immediately after this one, namely: \ref{unlock_car_section}.

Its purpose is that of allowing users to open, get on and drive the actual vehicle that they rented via the dedicated service. This feature requires the interaction of the user with both his/her mobile device and the on-board computer application.

The system must unlock a car upon being provided with the PIN from the user that reserved it. The on-board computer application must keep track of every important detail of user rides, such as the current charges, the nearby free charging spots and the boundaries of the Safe Area, all while notifying correspondingly the driver.

The on-board computer application will detect the beginning and end of the ride, counting the charges accordingly. Also, the system will be able to detect wheter the car is inside the Safe Area or not: if this is not the case, the user will be notified and the charges will keep increasing.
