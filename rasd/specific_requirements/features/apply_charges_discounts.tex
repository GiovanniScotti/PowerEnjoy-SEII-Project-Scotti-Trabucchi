\subsubsection{Purpose}
The system is able to incentivize virtuous users and discourage bad ones thanks to discounts and additional charges that are applied in the context of a specific ride. Whenever the system detects one or more of these situations, it notifies the user and updates the ride current charges.

\subsubsection{Scenario 1}

\subsubsection{Use-case}
The apply additional charges use-case is shown in Table \ref{apply_additional_charges_uc}.
The apply discount use-case is shown in Table \ref{apply_discounts_uc}.

\subsubsection{Functional requirements}
\begin{enumerate}
\item The system must be aware of a set of virtuous and additional-charges situations;
\item The system must memorize, in the context of the current ride, the discounts and additional charges in order to correctly charge the user at the end of the ride;
\item The system must notify the user whenever a discount/additional charge situation is detected;
\item The system shall be aware of the number of people inside a rented car;
\item The system shall be aware of the battery level of any rented car;
\item The system must recognize if, at the end of a ride, the user puts the plug in the car;
\item The system must know about the location of power grid stations in the Safe Area;
\item If the system detects two or more virtuous situations, only the one with the biggest discount will be applied;
\item If the system detects two or more situations of additional charges, all their effects on the current charge will be applied.
\end{enumerate}

Event Flow & 
\begin{enumerate}
\item The system checks for a pending discount on the current user ride;
\item If there is any, the system compares it with the new one and keeps the higher discount;
\item The system memorizes the discount and links it to the user current ride;

Output Condition & The system notifies the user about the incoming discount on the current charge.\\

Exception & If a higher discount is detected at point 2, the user is notified about the new discount percentage.\\
