The system implementation will open the possibility of including new features. For example:

\begin{itemize}
\item The possibility of including more categories of vehicles, such as motorcycles and bycicles;
\item The possibility of receiving active feedback from the users, mainly concerning car conditions;
\item The possibility for everyone, registered and unregistered people, of notifying \emph{PowerEnJoy} of incorrect or unsafe situations involving their vehicles;
\item The implementation of a new front-end application to make the management of out-of-order vehicles much more easier.
\end{itemize}
